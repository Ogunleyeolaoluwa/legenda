1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,124
Uh-oh, she's
got that bounce.

2
00:00:09,193 --> 00:00:10,626
Do I need to call HR?

3
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:14,129
No, I mean the bounce of a cop
who just put away a bad guy.

4
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:16,198
After a hell of a long day
in court.

5
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,066
Detectives?
Got a lady here

6
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:19,535
saying she needs
to report a murder.

7
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:23,005
All right. Thanks, Meyers.

8
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:27,943
DANNY:
Detective Reagan,

9
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:30,178
my partner Detective Baez.

10
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:31,280
And you are?

11
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:32,814
Uh, Roxy Smith.

12
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:34,182
So who got murdered,
Ms. Smith?

13
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,018
I don't know.

14
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:37,352
I-I mean, they
haven't been yet,

15
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:39,354
I don't think.

16
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:41,123
Sorry, all this
has me creeped out.

17
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,858
And us confused.

18
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:47,162
I tend bar at a place
on Avenue B, The Clasp.

19
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:48,697
Last night,
I overheard

20
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,699
one of our regulars, Joe,

21
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:53,302
saying he'd pay
to have someone killed.

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,703
Like, serious money.

23
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:56,538
I'm familiar
with The Clasp.

24
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:59,408
It's half barflies, half
college students, all drunk.

25
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,643
Including all of the bartenders.

26
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:03,645
Okay.

27
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:05,247
I had a couple shots.

28
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:06,548
Mm.
And if we know anything,

29
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:09,318
it's that drunk people say
drunk things.

30
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:10,852
But this Joe guy's
sick in the head.

31
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:12,321
And a crap tipper.

32
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:14,022
Not that that matters.

33
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:15,991
Apparently, it does.
Look,

34
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,900
people who hurt other people
should be stopped.

35
00:01:19,797 --> 00:01:21,797
Sit tight.

36
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,268
I don't know. This
whole thing seems thin.

37
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:27,869
Yea-- (exhales)

38
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:30,739
You know, the second collar
I ever had in my career

39
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:33,008
was a guy
named Frank Blake.

40
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:35,210
Did security
at The Clasp.

41
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:36,678
He, uh, threw out
some kids.

42
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:38,613
One of them mouthed off.

43
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:39,948
He snapped.

44
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,883
Jammed a pool cue
into the kid's eye.

45
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:44,553
Killed him on the spot.

46
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,622
So, what does
that mean?

47
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,459
Means I'm gonna
have to, uh...

48
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,729
make another appearance.

49
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:00,769
You know,

50
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:02,704
it's called "quitting time"
for a reason.

51
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:05,107
Great. Thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

52
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,175
Come on. Four nights in a row?

53
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:09,745
Even the bad guys
sleep sometimes.

54
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:12,414
And yet cases still don't
magically get themselves ready

55
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:13,615
for court.

56
00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:15,050
Anything I
can help with?

57
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:17,619
Yeah.

58
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:20,222
Explain to me again
why we hired Alice Dornan

59
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,124
as our psychiatric consultant.

60
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:23,458
'Cause she's a
top-notch shrink.

61
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:24,593
Who's now saying

62
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:25,727
that Martina Volo,

63
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:27,273
the nanny that abused
that little girl,

64
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:29,765
is not competent to stand trial.

65
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:30,899
Well, maybe she's right.

66
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:33,368
Or maybe she's the one
who's out of her mind.

67
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:35,570
Why? Because you don't like
her diagnosis?

68
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,173
Martina Volo
is competent and guilty--

69
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,308
no ifs, ands or buts about it.

70
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:43,578
Look, I'm the last guy
to defend an insanity plea,

71
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:46,581
but Dornan's got scads
of forensic experience

72
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,585
and knows a lot more about
this stuff than me or you.

73
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:53,255
Fine. Then call her and tell her
to be here tomorrow

74
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:54,990
at 10:00 a.m. sharp.

75
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:57,259
Erin, it's late.
She's not in.

76
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:58,560
Then leave a message.

77
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:00,896
Because I want to hear
this expert opinion of hers

78
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,330
in person.

79
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:16,111
Where-where are you going?

80
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,479
Where you just said.

81
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:19,080
You just missed the turn.

82
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:20,482
Traffic that way sucks.

83
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:22,751
Westbound lanes are
under construction.

84
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,020
So you're Google Maps now?

85
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:30,459
I do have some experience
with streets in this sector.

86
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:32,672
And when you're my driver,
you go the way I tell you to.

87
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:33,696
You got it?

88
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,932
Course.

89
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:44,473
So, what house were you in
before you came to the 2-9?

90
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,409
Also when driving me...

91
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,312
quiet is better.

92
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,858
There he is.

93
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:05,227
Mr. Mayor-Elect.

94
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:07,195
Just "Peter," Commissioner.

95
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:08,730
Then just "Frank."

96
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,799
Please.

97
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:15,804
Congratulations
on your election.

98
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:17,305
Thank you.

99
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:20,308
I got to say, none
of the mayors I served under

100
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:22,644
got the kind of margin you got.

101
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:26,047
Meaning, does he think
he has a mandate?

102
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,783
Just a fact.

103
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,753
I think we ran a smart campaign.

104
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:34,756
But it'd be dumb to take
the credit for a tidal change.

105
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,358
I just caught the wave.

106
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:38,727
Here we are.

107
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,664
And where is that?

108
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,967
Word is you don't enter a room

109
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,069
without knowing
why you've been invited.

110
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:52,908
I heard rumors
you want me to stay on.

111
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,709
I do.

112
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:56,645
When I like
what somebody's doing,

113
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,246
I want 'em to keep doing it.

114
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,415
(chuckles)
And when you don't?

115
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:02,017
You and I
will talk.

116
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,953
Not through channels,
not through the press.

117
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:10,625
Bucking a City Hall tradition
that goes way back.

118
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:13,895
I had sit-downs
with all the former mayors.

119
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:16,498
Mayor Poole told me a story--

120
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,367
you taking him on a ride-along,
Mm.

121
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:21,536
pointing out guys
clearly packing weapons

122
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:24,072
who you couldn't bust
on account of his policies.

123
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:29,077
I think it brought him conflict
at the time.

124
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:32,480
I walked away thinking
that's just plain wrong.

125
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:37,319
I want the NYPD to reinstate
Stop, Question and Frisk.

126
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:39,788
Hey, at least
you got the term right.

127
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:41,756
That hardly ever happens.

128
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:44,326
Homework.

129
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,328
We...

130
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,997
still employ a version of that.

131
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,332
A watered-down one.

132
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,001
Bring it back to 100 proof.

133
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,137
There's also a law on the books
that's been dry-docked,

134
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:57,739
332.10.

135
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:58,974
Vagrancy enforcement.

136
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,943
Tourism's a $44 billion
business in this city.

137
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:07,148
But not if Tex, Sven and Hideki
are afraid to leave the hotel.

138
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:09,851
And put the homeless where?

139
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,254
I'll redirect funding
to more shelters.

140
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:16,825
You hit the ground running.

141
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:20,295
(chuckles): There's
a lot of ground to cover.

142
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:23,164
(grunts softly)

143
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,233
So,

144
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,235
what's the ask?

145
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,839
Word is you never enter a room
without one.

146
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:35,510
I want you to make
a personnel change.

147
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:37,379
I have a couple
of recommendations

148
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:40,649
for your new DCPI.

149
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:47,689
Garrett Moore
is supremely fit for the job.

150
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:49,557
He's smart, quick on his feet,

151
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:53,161
well-liked by the press
and all the city agencies.

152
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,563
And that is a bad thing how?

153
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:57,699
He needs to be liked.

154
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:59,634
He basks in being liked.

155
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:01,036
He's a Labrador retriever,

156
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:02,837
and you're gonna need
a pit bull.

157
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:05,807
I want to take
this city back,

158
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,809
and your guys are my Marines.

159
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:11,212
There's gonna be pushback
that Garrett's gonna cave under.

160
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:12,347
And you know I'm right,

161
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,716
as sure as you're sitting here.

165
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:44,644
Really? The whole tour?

166
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:46,513
Oh, every turn I made,

167
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:48,174
where I suggested
we take our meal.

168
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:49,116
(groans)

169
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:51,718
Even the way I radioed Central,
she criticized.

170
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:53,720
I thought she'd
warm up to you.

171
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:56,089
Mm. Apparently,
she only has two settings,

172
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:58,091
cold and colder.

173
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,023
Want me to talk to her?

174
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:01,047
That is exactly
what I do not want.

175
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:03,463
I can be very charming.
And I am a big girl,

176
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:05,265
and I can fight my own battles.

177
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,400
I shouldn't have even told you.

178
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:09,669
Why? Why not?
That's what husbands are for.

179
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:11,905
When you're on the clock,
you're just another sergeant.

180
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:14,152
Okay. Well, I'm a sergeant
who doesn't like other sergeants

181
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:16,042
running roughshod
all over his people.

182
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:18,879
Especially the hottest
patrol officer in the...

183
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:20,947
history of hot patrol officers.

184
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:22,883
(scoffs)
Even after an eight-hour tour

185
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:26,453
in a stinky car
with a person that hates me?

186
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:29,055
Oh, I meant Jenkins.
He's very clean.

187
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,459
Oh. Go back to work.

188
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:35,595
Hey, listen, get some sleep.
Don't worry about McNichols.

189
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:37,108
The more she gets to know
the real Eddie Janko,

190
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:39,310
the more she'll fall in love
with her like the rest of us.

191
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:41,034
Mm.

192
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,904
Love you.
Be safe.

193
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,708
Have a seat, Dr. Dornan.

194
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:50,043
Thank you.

195
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,311
So, you claim

196
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,979
that Martina Volo was crazy

197
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:56,116
when she smacked around
the little girl in her care.

198
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:58,451
"Crazy" isn't a word I use.

199
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,120
Are you aware
that even

200
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:01,499
the defense's shrink
is not arguing

201
00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:03,223
that she was
mentally incompetent?

202
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,592
Their opinion
doesn't change mine.

203
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:07,861
But it's your opinion
that this office should just...

204
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,462
give up?

205
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:13,233
My job is to evaluate
the defendant,

206
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,001
not make legal recommendations.

207
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,169
Well, thank God for that.

208
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:17,278
What Ms. Reagan
means is...

209
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,339
No, I can speak
for myself, Anthony.

210
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:23,810
The facts of this case
are very clear, Doctor.

211
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,146
She beat up
a six-year-old little girl

212
00:09:26,214 --> 00:09:27,981
and then walked
to the nearest police station

213
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,983
and gave a complete confession.

214
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:31,918
When I interviewed her,
she exhibited signs

215
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:33,653
of disorganized speech
and delusions

216
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:34,487
of reference

217
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:35,822
consistent with schizophrenia.

218
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:37,691
And now you just want
to set her free.

219
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,404
Being remanded
to a psychiatric institution

220
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:41,261
is hardly being set free.

221
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,864
Do you have children,
Dr. Dornan?

222
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:47,934
Am I on trial here?
Erin...

223
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:49,769
No, you're not on trial,
nor will this office

224
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:51,771
be needing your help
in the future.

225
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,707
Ms. Reagan,

226
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,609
I've made similar evaluations
before,

227
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:58,044
and you've never...
Have a nice day. Thank you.

228
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:08,989
Erin, I-I'm sorry,

229
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:11,625
but what the...
Thank you for bringing her down.

230
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:31,878
Tough day?

231
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:33,146
(sighs)

232
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,882
What makes you
say that?

233
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:39,519
Decades of experience
reading my son.

234
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:41,821
Well, I met
with the new mayor today.

235
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,423
He want to replace you?

236
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:45,792
Go figure.
He wants me to stay on.

237
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:50,196
But he wants me
to replace my right hand.

238
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:52,399
What's he got against Garrett?

239
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,734
Doesn't think he's tough enough
to handle the flak.

240
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:57,537
Then let him hire
his own flak guy.

241
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:00,974
Well, his plan,
if and when carried out,

242
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:03,410
is gonna bring a lot
of heat to us.

243
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:06,312
And it ain't gonna be
just a bunch of deputy mayors

244
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:08,581
rousting the homeless
or frisking the shifty.

245
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,450
It's gonna be us.

246
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,720
Garrett can be as
slippery as they come.

247
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:16,056
Did you tell Chase that?

248
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:18,191
Not in so many words, but yeah.

249
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:22,696
(sighs)
There's a question

250
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:24,931
behind the question here.

251
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,932
What do you mean?

252
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,434
Think. Think.

253
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:30,437
Okay.

254
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:34,207
I <i>think</i> he sees me as useful.

255
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,942
That's usually a good sign.

256
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:37,977
But, uh, wait.

257
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:41,014
He wants to reinstate
some policies and laws

258
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,783
that are gonna be very unpopular
with some people.

259
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:47,454
He might find it useful
just to point to me and say,

260
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:49,723
"If you don't like it,
talk to him."

261
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,992
And are they policies and
laws that you want to enforce?

262
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:56,362
Within reason,
and for the right reasons.

263
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:59,365
Oh. That's slippery.

264
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:03,002
Maybe you should
be your own DCPI.

265
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:06,005
(chuckles):
Well, what I mean is,

266
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:08,675
as long as it doesn't
adversely affect our citizens

267
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:10,910
in service to our tourists.

268
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:14,247
Is that's what's driving him?
All that "I Love New York" crap?

269
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,683
Some. I don't know how much.

270
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,418
What do you want to do?

271
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,020
I do not mind being useful.

272
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:26,693
But not just in service
to someone else's ends.

273
00:12:28,396 --> 00:12:29,929
Huh.

274
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:37,604
(indistinct chatter)

275
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:39,672
One more over here.

276
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:42,809
Thank you, Roxy.

277
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:45,545
And, uh, one more
for my friend here.

278
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:47,781
What are you drinking
there, buddy?

279
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:49,149
Whiskey.

280
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:50,884
You know, make mine
a whiskey, too.

281
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:55,021
Place is jumping
as usual, huh?

282
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,556
As usual?

283
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,192
Never seen you before.

284
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:02,061
Come in all the time
when I'm not in the can.

285
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,897
Buddy Mullane.

286
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:05,932
Joe.
Joe what?

287
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:07,267
Joe None-Of-Your-Business.

288
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:10,136
Think your brother-in-law
was in my unit--

289
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:12,739
Larry Get-Outta-My-Face.

290
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:18,611
Unit, huh?
Yup.

291
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,147
You military?
Former Marine.

292
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:24,017
Till the bastards
threw me in the brig.

293
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:26,953
Some knucklehead forgot
that he owed me a few bucks,

294
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:29,856
so I bounced his head
off a curb a few times.

295
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,091
The world is full
of double-crossers.

296
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,693
Yup.

297
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:35,762
There's nothing
like sweet payback.

298
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:40,133
Thank you.
Joe Kiernan.

299
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:42,035
(exhales)

300
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:43,603
You ever do time, Joe?

301
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:45,038
I'm smarter than that.

302
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:47,707
Hmm. So you're
saying I'm dumb?

303
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:51,177
I just mean,

304
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:54,214
when I got a score
to settle, I farm it out.

305
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:58,051
Well, when I have a score
to settle, I handle it myself.

306
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:08,595
How you doing on cash, Buddy?

307
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:11,264
Oh, everybody needs cash.

308
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,067
Well, maybe I got a job for you.

309
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:15,535
What's the job?

310
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,604
A job.

311
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,908
Oh. Someone crossed you?

312
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,443
Like you don't even know.

313
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:25,011
WOMAN:
Here's your next play.

314
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,813
(women shouting)

315
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:29,616
MAN: Get off of her!
(glass breaks)

316
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:31,351
(laughing):
Oh, here we go.

317
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:32,919
Look at that.

318
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:34,787
Hey, where you going, Joe?

319
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:36,489
Maybe some other time.

320
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:39,626
Thought you needed my help.
281 East Snyder in Flatbush.

321
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:41,628
Come by tomorrow, we'll talk.

322
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:43,363
MAN: Break it up!
Break it up!

323
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:49,035
Did he tell you?

324
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:52,205
Not yet, but I got
my hooks in him.

325
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:13,815
If you're going to be lurking
in my office,

326
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:15,951
the least you can do
is let me know.

327
00:15:19,323 --> 00:15:22,457
Saves me the trouble of looking
all over the floor for you.

328
00:15:23,694 --> 00:15:25,226
You know, I get it.

329
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:27,662
There's something calming
about the view from here.

330
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:34,069
What are you calming yourself
about?

331
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,807
Change, I guess.

332
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:42,944
Change is supposed
to be constant.

333
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:45,080
But not around here.

334
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:50,185
Until today?

335
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:57,659
I have an offer that
I don't think I can pass up.

336
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,099
Oh.

337
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:07,836
So this isn't a conversation?

338
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:09,270
It's news...

339
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:12,173
that I wanted
to share first with you.

340
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:13,375
(sighs)

341
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:14,976
Must be a hell of an offer.

342
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,444
Head of Institutional

343
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:18,913
Development for Duke University.

344
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:21,216
Travel to Europe, Asia,

345
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:22,684
preach the gospel

346
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:26,554
that the athletics powerhouse is
also an academic one.

347
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,823
Wow.

348
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:33,862
They've come at you before, no?

349
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,865
Colleges have, but not Duke.

350
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,534
And not like this.

351
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:41,536
Well...

352
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,638
Congratulations.

353
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:45,473
Thank you.

354
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,475
Tell me something.

355
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:49,844
Does the timing strike you
as, oh...

356
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:52,080
anything?

357
00:16:53,116 --> 00:16:54,716
How so?

358
00:16:56,153 --> 00:16:59,821
Well, we got a new mayor
coming in, résumés going out.

359
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,856
Let's be clear. This came to me.
I wasn't looking.

360
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:05,794
Okay, okay.
I'm just... thinking out loud.

361
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:08,997
I don't think colleges track
our City Hall transitions.

362
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:11,032
The timing's just...

363
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:12,734
is what it is.

364
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,306
I will be very sorry
to see you go.

365
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,308
That goes without saying.

366
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:22,243
But I appreciate you saying it.

367
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:26,047
And I'll help
with my replacement, of course.

368
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:28,516
(sighs)
I'll need it.

369
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:32,053
We can talk timelines...
another time.

370
00:17:39,796 --> 00:17:41,730
So...

371
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:43,798
on with our day?

372
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:50,905
Yes.

373
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:10,225
(indistinct chatter)

374
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:13,061
Hey, Joe! You ready
to rock and roll or what?

375
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,130
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not here, not here.

376
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,703
You know what I
don't need from you?

377
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:23,004
Bunch of smart-ass comments.

378
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:24,572
Hey, hey, relax.

379
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:26,307
Well, the job--
who is it?

380
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:27,308
Roxy.

381
00:18:27,377 --> 00:18:28,843
At The Clasp?

382
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:31,112
Me and her used to be together.
I noticed you didn't

383
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,680
say two words to her last night.

384
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:34,716
'Cause she broke up with me
for no reason.

385
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:36,184
Now I got to watch her flirt

386
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:37,864
with every jerk
who walks through the bar.

387
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:39,654
How much?

388
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:41,022
Ten large.

389
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:42,824
I'll take half up front.

390
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:44,259
That's doable.

391
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:45,994
I got a guy
in Jersey doing

392
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:47,796
a chemical cleanup
on an EPA site.

393
00:18:47,864 --> 00:18:50,331
I'll bat her over the head,
throw her in a vat.

394
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,766
No.

395
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:53,935
You want the money,
you do it my way.

396
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:56,004
I got a piece of land

397
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:57,972
in Washingtonville
I'm gonna build a place on.

398
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,308
Take her up there,
put one between her eyes,

399
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:02,443
dig a grave and cover her up.

400
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:04,179
You want me to dig a grave?

401
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:07,015
Yeah. A deep one.

402
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,517
Okay. I'll need a few days.

403
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:11,097
Thought you said
you came to rock and roll.

404
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:13,354
You ever dig a grave?

405
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:15,089
Well, hurry it up,

406
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:18,693
'cause every day I got to see
this bitch is one day too many.

407
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:25,767
(phone vibrates)

408
00:19:27,904 --> 00:19:30,538
Hey, I just sent you
the contract for the new shrink.

409
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:33,174
Can you arrange for him to meet
with Martina Volo immediately?

410
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:35,176
So Dornan's really out?

411
00:19:35,245 --> 00:19:36,711
Yeah. You thought I was joking?

412
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,046
Erin, sit.

413
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:39,214
What?

414
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:40,282
You heard me.

415
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:42,750
Why?
Just humor me.

416
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:44,652
Please.

417
00:19:45,655 --> 00:19:47,522
I think I know what's going on.

418
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:49,290
Is there something going on?

419
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,992
Yeah. With you.

420
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:54,195
The-the long hours, the marching
around pissed at the world.

421
00:19:54,264 --> 00:19:55,997
I'm fine.
I'm just saying.

422
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:58,099
It-It's okay
to feel a little lost.

423
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:01,636
About what?
Erin,

424
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:04,539
the only thing
you ever wanted was to be D.A.

425
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:06,474
Then, when you finally
get the chance,

426
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:08,243
you decide
it's not what you wanted.

427
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:10,211
No, I just put a pin in that...
And this

428
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,946
never-ending
whatever-it-is with Jack.

429
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:13,081
And Nicky

430
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:14,616
moving across the country,

431
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:16,818
so no more morning coffee
with your best friend

432
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:18,086
and no more dinners

433
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:19,621
to make when
she gets home.

434
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,723
I have no idea
what you're saying.

435
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,558
I'm saying, I get it.

436
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:26,261
A little midlife crisis happens
to all of us.

437
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:27,962
(laughing):
Oh. Okay, all right.

438
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,164
Why don't we just hire you
as the shrink?

439
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:33,201
You know, the-the floor
dropped out for me

440
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,870
when I left the NYPD,
my marriage went kaput.

441
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:39,774
Hell, I-I'm still heartbroken
over not seeing Sophia

442
00:20:39,843 --> 00:20:42,710
every day, and she
just lives in Jersey.

443
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,246
Okay. Can we get back
to work, please?

444
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:47,949
And thank you for this,
whatever this was.

445
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:54,489
(sighs)

446
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:00,194
(McNichols speaking quietly)

447
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:02,597
All right.
All right, be safe, okay?

448
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,732
Refueling.

449
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:06,134
Just in time.

450
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:08,736
Keep that straight, will ya?

451
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:10,338
Oh, yeah, my hair is...

452
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:12,040
It's a little puffy tonight.

453
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:13,441
(sighs)

454
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,510
Geez, how many sugars
did you put in there?

455
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:17,578
Okay.

456
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:21,749
You have a problem with me?

457
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:23,017
Problem?
Yeah.

458
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:25,486
You've hated my guts
ever since I came on midnights.

459
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:28,690
And now, you make me
your driver.

460
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:29,891
You're imagining things.

461
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,993
No, I'm seeing what's
right in front of me.

462
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:33,261
You think I'm a zero?

463
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,296
Is that it?
Am... am I a bad cop?

464
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:37,665
No, you're pretty solid.

465
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:39,000
You do talk too much.

466
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:40,735
I can never figure out

467
00:21:40,804 --> 00:21:42,048
where the heck
you're driving me,

468
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:44,305
but I'm not gonna ding you
for your last name.

469
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:46,174
Janko?

470
00:21:46,242 --> 00:21:48,343
I mean your
married name.

471
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:49,544
Reagan.

472
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:51,579
That's all I'm gonna say.

473
00:21:51,648 --> 00:21:52,648
No, w-wait.

474
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:54,048
What does that mean?

475
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:57,819
Jamie do something to you?

476
00:21:57,887 --> 00:21:59,754
Not your husband.
Who?

477
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:02,957
My father-in-law?

478
00:22:03,026 --> 00:22:04,026
Yeah, try "fraud."

479
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,093
And a hypocrite.

480
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:07,595
You can't be serious.

481
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:09,697
Frank Reagan
sits up there at One PP,

482
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:11,966
spouting about how all of us
should be so happy

483
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:14,002
to be part of the NYPD family.

484
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,338
He could give a rat's ass
about any family but his own.

485
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:19,374
Especially not mine.

486
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:21,642
So...

487
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:23,511
drop the charm offensive

488
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,879
and let's go.

489
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:33,588
Joe said I was his girlfriend?

490
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:36,491
Or ex-- enough to want
you dead either way.

491
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,092
We went out maybe twice.

492
00:22:38,161 --> 00:22:39,627
First time wasn't even a date.

493
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:41,562
We just kept drinking
after closing time.

494
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:43,398
And went home
together.

495
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:45,099
And it was fun.

496
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:48,002
Viagra's a hell of a drug.

497
00:22:48,071 --> 00:22:49,348
Then, I found out
he lives with a girl

498
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:51,739
and I told him to go to hell,
and still,

499
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:53,074
he comes in and
stink-eyes me

500
00:22:53,143 --> 00:22:54,876
whenever I so much
as talk to another guy.

501
00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:57,078
It's like you said,
sick in the head.

502
00:22:57,147 --> 00:22:58,507
Yeah, so now
you arrest him, right?

503
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:01,549
Not till we have more.
Right.

504
00:23:01,618 --> 00:23:03,618
You guys said you recorded him.

505
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:04,886
But a judge
could still

506
00:23:04,954 --> 00:23:07,555
toss it saying it's just words.

507
00:23:07,624 --> 00:23:09,184
But we still have to
go through with it.

508
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:10,225
Not all the way.

509
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:11,459
We fake your death,

510
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:12,960
take a picture, show him,

511
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:15,730
convince him it's real,
get the payment.

512
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,732
Is he serious?

513
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,033
And right.

514
00:23:26,195 --> 00:23:28,362
What are we eating, exactly?

515
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,763
Oh, it's meant
to be chicken parm.

516
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:31,598
You've had chicken parm
a million times.

517
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:34,968
I don't recall it
being so resilient.

518
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:36,937
(laughs)
JANKO: It's very good.

519
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:38,805
My compliments
to the chef.

520
00:23:38,874 --> 00:23:40,674
Thank you.
You made this?

521
00:23:40,743 --> 00:23:42,342
First Sunday dinner
all by myself.

522
00:23:42,411 --> 00:23:43,610
It's delicious, Sean.

523
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,789
DANNY: Yeah.
You might've got the piece

524
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:45,946
that was meant for me--

525
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:47,347
He's a little
upset 'cause

526
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,361
we're having a disagreement
about upping his allowance.

527
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:51,151
Call it cost of
living adjustments.

528
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,022
Try bankrolling
a kid in San Francisco.

529
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,801
Well, I think he should get
whatever he wants.

530
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:59,192
Uh-huh, you two wait till
you start popping them out.

531
00:23:59,261 --> 00:24:00,827
See how tight
your wallet gets then.

532
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:01,896
Exactly.

533
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:03,230
What about you, Francis?

534
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:06,433
Always live within your means.

535
00:24:06,502 --> 00:24:08,880
And you can live in your car,
but you can't drive your house,

536
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:10,571
so budget accordingly.

537
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:13,040
No, no. I meant
your review of dinner.

538
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:15,075
Five stars, Sean.

539
00:24:16,412 --> 00:24:18,011
But you've hardly had a bite.

540
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,846
Take it back.

541
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:21,949
Six stars, okay?

542
00:24:22,017 --> 00:24:23,017
Well...

543
00:24:26,322 --> 00:24:27,554
You okay?

544
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:29,289
Oh...

545
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:31,725
you know, the usual.

546
00:24:31,794 --> 00:24:35,362
Any developments
in the usual front?

547
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:38,765
Download you later, Pop, okay?

548
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:40,634
Okay.

549
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:42,336
JANKO: Is there
a family code

550
00:24:42,404 --> 00:24:44,071
I'm missing?

551
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:46,440
I figure it out,
I'll let you know.

552
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,176
Okay.

553
00:24:49,244 --> 00:24:50,377
Okay...

554
00:24:52,147 --> 00:24:55,449
There may be some personnel
changes in my office.

555
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:57,351
But it's confidential...

556
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,019
until it isn't.

557
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:00,432
Oh, well, that really
clears things up.

558
00:25:00,456 --> 00:25:01,456
And...

559
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:05,592
...I think I'm realizing
something about myself.

560
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:07,127
I hate change.

561
00:25:07,196 --> 00:25:09,563
<i>You</i> want the things

562
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,965
that you like to stay
the way that they are?

563
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:13,700
Yeah, but worse.

564
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:16,837
I am willing to give up
trying to change the things

565
00:25:16,905 --> 00:25:19,740
I don't like in order
to keep the ones I do.

566
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:22,175
I've seen you change like
the seasons my whole life.

567
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:24,911
Well, I thought it would
make me a better person.

568
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,748
But I'm kind of done with that,
truth be told.

569
00:25:27,816 --> 00:25:28,915
Being a better person?

570
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:32,586
Uh, maybe this is
as good as it gets.

571
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,254
You could do worse.

572
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:36,923
A compliment.

573
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:40,827
There's a saying
I always hang onto.

574
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:44,231
"Everything comes to pass,
nothing comes to stay."

575
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:45,465
Yeah, I heard that one.

576
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:46,733
Who said that?

577
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:49,002
I'm not sure--
some wise old soul.

578
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:50,404
FRANK:
Yeah, I looked it up.

579
00:25:50,472 --> 00:25:52,906
It's from one of those
'70s self-help books

580
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:56,376
by a guy never heard from
before or since.

581
00:25:56,445 --> 00:25:58,612
But, hey, if it works for you.

582
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:00,380
Oh.

583
00:26:00,449 --> 00:26:02,716
You're really fun today, Dad.

584
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:04,229
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I pulled a rib out

585
00:26:04,253 --> 00:26:06,319
from laughing so hard.

586
00:26:08,924 --> 00:26:09,924
Okay?

587
00:26:09,992 --> 00:26:12,125
Okay, thank you very much.

588
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:13,126
Thank you.

589
00:26:13,195 --> 00:26:15,128
SEAN:
Listen, I get it.

590
00:26:15,197 --> 00:26:17,297
Like, it-it really sucks
when somebody leaves,

591
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:18,799
especially somebody
that you, like,

592
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:21,068
actually like,
or-or used to.

593
00:26:21,136 --> 00:26:23,336
Thank you.

594
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:24,971
Where's this
coming from?

595
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,685
Well, if I get more allowance--
hear me out--

596
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:29,476
I could go visit
Jack at college.

597
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:32,012
I save up a little bit more,
I can go visit Nicky.

598
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:34,181
DANNY: Mm-hmm.
That's very sweet.

599
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:35,449
Watch it, he's getting better.

600
00:26:35,484 --> 00:26:36,416
I ain't buying it.

601
00:26:36,485 --> 00:26:37,784
It's the truth.
Pass the salad.

602
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:38,785
Nice try.

603
00:26:38,854 --> 00:26:40,087
It was worth a try.

604
00:26:40,155 --> 00:26:43,156
(Erin laughs)
(Danny groans)

605
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:49,930
(knocking)

606
00:26:49,998 --> 00:26:51,064
Come in.

607
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,133
(door creaks open)

608
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:54,000
Patrick, you're early...

609
00:26:56,405 --> 00:26:58,872
Firing me once wasn't enough?

610
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:00,907
Look, just hear me out.

611
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:03,288
The Brooklyn D.A. already called
to say I won't be consulting

612
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:05,045
for them anymore, either--
thanks for that.

613
00:27:05,114 --> 00:27:06,313
That wasn't me, Doc.

614
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:08,949
And sometimes the other
offices hear things...

615
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:10,717
And now I'm paying the price.

616
00:27:10,786 --> 00:27:13,653
Look, I'm here because...

617
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:15,622
I was way out of line
the other day.

618
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:17,157
Yes, you were.

619
00:27:17,226 --> 00:27:19,092
It's just that a case
involving a nanny

620
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:21,328
who hurt a little child,
just feels like

621
00:27:21,396 --> 00:27:23,363
it should be a slam dunk.

622
00:27:23,432 --> 00:27:25,499
Unless the facts
dictate otherwise.

623
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:27,434
Doc, you render opinions.

624
00:27:27,503 --> 00:27:30,804
Based on medical
and psychiatric facts.

625
00:27:32,274 --> 00:27:35,542
The same mix of art and science
you practice in your profession.

626
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:38,745
Fair enough.

627
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:43,884
So, you stand by
what you said?

628
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:47,654
I'll admit I didn't at first.

629
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:49,589
Really?

630
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:52,392
Ever since I was
brutally mugged last year,

631
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:55,896
I've wanted revenge
on every violent person I see.

632
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:01,568
Part of me agrees
with you completely.

633
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:05,605
Wants to see Martina Volo
thrown down a deep, dark hole.

634
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:10,510
But once I realized

635
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:12,546
where that was coming from...

636
00:28:12,614 --> 00:28:16,449
You ignored that part
and did your job.

637
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:22,789
Right.

638
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:34,601
This is a one-off.

639
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,836
Understood.

640
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:37,404
I am making this exception

641
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:39,105
because I think
I can shed some light

642
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:40,674
where it's needed.

643
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:41,975
I appreciate it.

644
00:28:42,044 --> 00:28:43,109
Long story short,

645
00:28:43,178 --> 00:28:44,845
Sergeant McNichols likely thinks

646
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:47,147
that the commissioner
ruined her marriage.

647
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:49,349
How?

648
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:51,718
Two years ago,
McNichols' ex-husband

649
00:28:51,787 --> 00:28:54,554
was accused by a partner
of taking free meals

650
00:28:54,623 --> 00:28:56,323
and kickback money from a store

651
00:28:56,391 --> 00:28:57,490
in their sector.

652
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,125
And abusive behavior

653
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:01,695
towards citizens
and fellow cops alike.

654
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:03,530
Husband's a jerk, too?

655
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,698
Shocker.

656
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:06,633
Except when IAB
interviewed the partner,

657
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:08,068
he suddenly recanted everything.

658
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:09,703
Said it was "a big
misunderstanding."

659
00:29:09,771 --> 00:29:11,304
Ah, he got to him.

660
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:13,473
Probably, so the commissioner
didn't let it go.

661
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:14,374
Well, why not?

662
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:16,576
Because he hates bullies.

663
00:29:16,645 --> 00:29:18,411
So, he was able
to discipline him on a couple

664
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,748
smaller offenses--
stealing time, leaving early.

665
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:22,817
Good.

666
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:24,251
But those habits
didn't go away.

667
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,919
They eventually cost him the job

668
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:27,921
and, I guess, his marriage.

669
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,789
She blames the commissioner?

670
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:31,658
Apparently.

671
00:29:31,727 --> 00:29:34,027
Nice not having
this conversation with you,

672
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:35,829
Officer.

673
00:29:47,142 --> 00:29:49,910
Okay, um, timeline was...

674
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:51,645
I was gonna look for you.

675
00:29:51,713 --> 00:29:53,113
And then Baker said
you were already

676
00:29:53,181 --> 00:29:56,016
in my office and then
you had your own news.

677
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:58,551
Look for me-- why?

678
00:30:01,223 --> 00:30:02,956
In my meeting
with the mayor-elect,

679
00:30:03,025 --> 00:30:06,760
he asked me to replace you
with a pit bull.

680
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:12,365
And you said yes?

681
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:14,534
No.

682
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:16,603
No...

683
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:19,139
but I didn't say no.

684
00:30:21,043 --> 00:30:23,243
Why a pit bull?

685
00:30:23,312 --> 00:30:25,979
He wants to equip us to deal
with things the hard way

686
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,248
when the easy way doesn't work.

687
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:31,718
A latitude I've wanted
for years, I might add.

688
00:30:33,388 --> 00:30:35,855
But for the rollout, you want
a wartime consigliere.

689
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:38,591
Well, he thinks so.

690
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,160
Me?

691
00:30:40,228 --> 00:30:42,329
I don't think so.

692
00:30:42,397 --> 00:30:43,730
You?

693
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,699
Me?

694
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:48,001
Yeah.

695
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:53,974
I-I think it's a very good idea
to give your new boss

696
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:56,309
a gimme at the start.

697
00:31:00,282 --> 00:31:01,581
Oh.

698
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:06,853
Okay.

699
00:31:06,922 --> 00:31:08,855
Okay, I may be on thin ice here,

700
00:31:08,924 --> 00:31:10,824
but bear with me, please?

701
00:31:12,861 --> 00:31:14,861
It surprise you at all,

702
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,364
when you got
that big offer from Duke?

703
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:22,569
It's not like I'm an unknown.

704
00:31:22,637 --> 00:31:24,471
I've had offers
from NYU, Notre Dame...

705
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:25,472
I know,

706
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,606
I know, I know,

707
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:29,576
and well, well-deserved.

708
00:31:29,644 --> 00:31:31,611
But not from Duke.

709
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,147
All I'm saying is

710
00:31:34,216 --> 00:31:36,583
were you surprised?

711
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:38,918
Yes, but pleasantly-- why?

712
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:42,822
Well, I know

713
00:31:42,891 --> 00:31:44,290
you like to know

714
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,359
all there is to know.

715
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:52,132
I'm hoping that's the case here.

716
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,067
Sure.

717
00:31:57,773 --> 00:32:00,974
The advice
to Woodward and Bernstein?

718
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:12,719
♪ ♪

719
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,591
And with that, the
makeup and stage blood.

720
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,260
Got a camera, too,
if you want it.

721
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:23,196
No. I'll take the picture
with my own phone.

722
00:32:23,265 --> 00:32:25,532
And once I get Joe
to make the final payment,

723
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,700
I'll get a picture of him
in handcuffs. Thank you.

724
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:30,003
We really gotta
do all this?

725
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:32,806
Just think of it like
Halloween and you'll be fine.

726
00:32:32,874 --> 00:32:34,307
Where's your partner?

727
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:36,487
She's keeping an eye on Joe at
The Clasp till we're finished.

728
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:38,611
Now let's go kill you.

729
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,946
Come on.

730
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:45,368
Over here.

731
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:54,877
ROXY:
Huh. It's so deep.

732
00:32:55,284 --> 00:32:58,052
Be glad you didn't
have to dig it.

733
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,673
It's okay.

734
00:32:59,741 --> 00:33:01,352
You're just gonna be
in there for a second.

735
00:33:01,376 --> 00:33:02,542
Just long enough
for me to get

736
00:33:02,611 --> 00:33:03,788
a picture of you looking
like you're dead.

737
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:05,345
Okay?

738
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,685
Just get you ready.

739
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:13,320
Thank you, Detective.

740
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:14,888
Thank me for what?

741
00:33:14,957 --> 00:33:16,423
For believing me.

742
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:17,569
Why wouldn't I believe you?

743
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:20,427
'Cause I work in a dump and...

744
00:33:20,496 --> 00:33:23,096
I'm not exactly
an upstanding citizen.

745
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:26,366
Well... consider it fate.

746
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:30,704
I need you to close
your eyes, okay?

747
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:42,415
How do I look?

748
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:44,751
Horrible.

749
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,186
And perfect.

750
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:50,290
Why don't you put the flashlight
down, get everything ready.

751
00:33:55,464 --> 00:33:57,531
Put this rope
around your wrists,

752
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,933
make it look like
you're tied up.

753
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:02,035
I'll lower you down
into the ditch.

754
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:04,871
Lay on your back and
I'll take the picture.

755
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,339
Reagan!

756
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:07,408
(yelling)

757
00:34:13,682 --> 00:34:15,015
You called it, Reagan.

758
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,816
A setup every step
of the way.

759
00:34:16,885 --> 00:34:18,351
Like father like daughter.

760
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,365
Surprised you didn't try
to kill me with a pool cue

761
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,489
like your old man did
that college kid.

762
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:23,957
When did you know?

763
00:34:24,026 --> 00:34:27,227
When you said, "People who hurt
other people should be stopped."

764
00:34:27,296 --> 00:34:28,595
Just like what you
yelled at me

765
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:31,364
at your old man's trial back
in the day, you remember?

766
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:33,667
(crying):
I was ten years old.

767
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:35,969
And you took my father away.

768
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:38,338
No.

769
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:40,373
Your father dug his own grave.

770
00:34:40,442 --> 00:34:42,342
Just like you did.

771
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:44,811
(crying)

772
00:34:52,788 --> 00:34:54,788
What's going on?

773
00:34:54,856 --> 00:34:56,289
Boss, I got to talk to you.

774
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:58,225
Again?
Not cop-to-cop.

775
00:34:58,293 --> 00:35:00,727
(sighs)
Woman-to-woman.

776
00:35:01,863 --> 00:35:04,497
Look, my husband...

777
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:06,666
he wants the
world to think

778
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:08,735
he's just like his father.

779
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:10,904
C-Can you get to it?

780
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:22,415
Jamie and I got in an
argument the other night.

781
00:35:22,484 --> 00:35:25,685
He was pissed because some
guy I know was texting me.

782
00:35:25,754 --> 00:35:27,787
And it wasn't
the first time.

783
00:35:27,856 --> 00:35:29,689
I tried to calm him down,

784
00:35:29,758 --> 00:35:32,125
and...

785
00:35:32,194 --> 00:35:33,526
he grabbed me by the throat.

786
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:34,928
Whoa.
No...

787
00:35:34,997 --> 00:35:36,329
Jamie put
his hands on you?

788
00:35:36,398 --> 00:35:38,265
No, really, it
wasn't his fault.

789
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:39,477
I should have
deleted the text.

790
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:40,433
I-I shouldn't...

791
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:42,002
Janko, no,
you're not to blame.

792
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,271
Please. I don't want
to jam him up.

793
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,139
We haven't even been
married that long.

794
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:47,607
That's all
the more reason...

795
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:49,209
I just...

796
00:35:49,278 --> 00:35:51,278
I want to be the wife
he needs me to be.

797
00:35:51,346 --> 00:35:52,579
Okay. Hey. No.

798
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:55,181
Nothing that you do
or anybody else does

799
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,517
gives him the right
to put his hands on you.

800
00:35:57,586 --> 00:35:59,319
Do you understand me?

801
00:35:59,388 --> 00:36:02,355
(stammers)
Jamie having a problem,

802
00:36:02,424 --> 00:36:05,158
that is not
your fault, Janko.

803
00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:11,031
Take your own advice.

804
00:36:13,168 --> 00:36:14,634
What?

805
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:17,804
Your ex-husband, Steve.

806
00:36:17,873 --> 00:36:20,040
He wasn't a
nice guy, was he?

807
00:36:22,844 --> 00:36:25,312
You talked to
your father-in-law?

808
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,514
No, but I hear
Steve was abusive,

809
00:36:27,582 --> 00:36:29,816
and I'm guessing he
didn't leave that at work.

810
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:31,718
You don't know
what you're talking about.

811
00:36:31,787 --> 00:36:33,186
He was hitting you.

812
00:36:33,255 --> 00:36:34,421
What?
Wasn't he?

813
00:36:35,724 --> 00:36:37,991
What? No.

814
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,492
Boss, you can hate me,

815
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:42,462
and the PC and anyone else
for what happened to you.

816
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:45,131
I know...

817
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,034
that sometimes that's easier
than hating the person

818
00:36:48,103 --> 00:36:51,838
who really made
your life hell.

819
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:54,574
But...

820
00:36:54,643 --> 00:36:56,876
please forgive yourself.

821
00:36:58,013 --> 00:36:59,713
I mean, like you just said,

822
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:02,382
nothing you did
made it okay

823
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:05,785
for him to do
what he did to you.

824
00:37:05,854 --> 00:37:07,987
Nothing.

825
00:37:13,895 --> 00:37:15,335
I should've known
that you were lying

826
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:18,765
when you said that Jamie
put his hands on you.

827
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:22,902
But everything I just
said about you is true.

828
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:34,247
I'll shut up now, like
you always wanted me to.

829
00:37:34,316 --> 00:37:36,316
(engine starts)

830
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,456
Well, I'd say justice
was served.

831
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:45,959
Hopefully, Ms. Volo will
get the help she needs.

832
00:37:46,027 --> 00:37:47,660
Thanks to your testimony.

833
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:48,962
Happy to help.

834
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,897
And when I call you
for the next case,

835
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:52,198
you won't hang up on me?

836
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:55,435
Not even if you want to
talk about anything else.

837
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:00,940
Hey.

838
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:02,075
So...

839
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:04,844
all's well
that ends well?

840
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:06,679
Yeah. I think that
the judge was surprised

841
00:38:06,748 --> 00:38:08,292
when I changed the
People's recommendation

842
00:38:08,316 --> 00:38:09,682
to psychiatric commitment,

843
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:12,419
but I think everyone agreed
it was the right thing to do.

844
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:13,920
I mean us.

845
00:38:16,024 --> 00:38:17,190
You know... (sighs)

846
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:18,858
Anthony, you were right.

847
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:21,761
You were seeing me a lot clearer
than I was seeing myself.

848
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,230
We're a team.

849
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:26,766
Yeah, but I overreacted,
and I'm sorry.

850
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:28,134
I'm really sorry.

851
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:29,903
Apology accepted.

852
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:31,805
Now lunch.
Wherever you want to go.

853
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:34,641
Really? Even,
like, fancy?

854
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:35,809
Why not?

855
00:38:35,877 --> 00:38:38,077
You're paying.

856
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:39,479
(elevator bell dings)

857
00:38:39,548 --> 00:38:40,814
Mayor-Elect Chase.

858
00:38:40,882 --> 00:38:41,948
I'm Detective Baker.

859
00:38:42,017 --> 00:38:43,283
Welcome to One PP.

860
00:38:43,351 --> 00:38:44,517
Nice to meet you.

861
00:38:44,586 --> 00:38:45,952
Would you like
some coffee, water?

862
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:47,187
I'm good, thank you.

863
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:48,588
And here we are.

864
00:38:51,193 --> 00:38:53,993
Afternoon.
Frank.

865
00:38:54,062 --> 00:38:55,395
Deputy Commissioner.

866
00:38:55,464 --> 00:38:56,563
Garrett.

867
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:58,531
Peter.

868
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,033
I know.

869
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:01,768
This is a surprise.

870
00:39:01,837 --> 00:39:03,970
I know.
I'm full of 'em today.

871
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:08,041
Would you like to sit down?

872
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:17,517
Couple things, if I may.

873
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:19,152
Please.

874
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:23,790
Guy finds out a job offer came

875
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:26,226
'cause another guy's wife heads
the Board of Trustees

876
00:39:26,294 --> 00:39:29,229
at the school,
and that together,

877
00:39:29,297 --> 00:39:30,897
they just donated 50 mil

878
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:33,800
for a new science building.

879
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:35,735
He does his homework.

880
00:39:35,804 --> 00:39:38,204
Makes the guy think
he's gonna be working

881
00:39:38,273 --> 00:39:40,240
with a whole bunch
of pissed-off people

882
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:42,742
who got passed over because
they didn't have a hook.

883
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:45,111
A hook's what we call
"influence" up here.

884
00:39:47,115 --> 00:39:50,683
Makes him...
not want the job so much.

885
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:56,189
So, did you know he punched
a Sulzberger in the nose

886
00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:59,092
in the Grill Room
at the Four Seasons?

887
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,427
I did not.

888
00:40:01,496 --> 00:40:03,029
He printed a bald-faced lie

889
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:04,597
about our counterterrorism
division.

890
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:05,932
He had it coming.

891
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:09,035
The <i>Times</i> printed a correction
the next day,

892
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:10,303
and an apology
the day after.

893
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:14,107
We lost the table,
but we won the war.

894
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:18,678
See, pit bulls get a bad rap.

895
00:40:18,747 --> 00:40:20,980
They're actually
loving protectors

896
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:22,815
of children and family,

897
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:24,117
unless you raise 'em mean.

898
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:27,086
That loving protection
becomes throat-ripping fury

899
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:28,688
when family's threatened.

900
00:40:28,757 --> 00:40:32,125
This guy just lost 80 pounds
the last year.

901
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:33,960
And it made him leaner,

902
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:36,829
but it also made him meaner,
if that's possible.

903
00:40:36,898 --> 00:40:38,798
When I need to be.

904
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:41,467
Guys, okay.

905
00:40:41,536 --> 00:40:44,037
Okay.

906
00:40:44,105 --> 00:40:46,606
Something you should know
about me.

907
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:49,876
I don't pave the way
for my people to succeed.

908
00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:52,045
Yeah. You like to put obstacles
in their way

909
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:53,613
to see how they handle
adversity.

910
00:40:53,682 --> 00:40:54,914
Yeah, we heard.

911
00:40:59,955 --> 00:41:03,823
I run, and he runs
interference for,

912
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:07,427
35,000 cops who are responsible
for the safety

913
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:10,964
and well-being
of 8.6 million citizens.

914
00:41:11,032 --> 00:41:14,233
And 65 million tourists.

915
00:41:14,302 --> 00:41:18,004
So we don't have time
for mind games.

916
00:41:18,073 --> 00:41:20,573
We have more than we can handle

917
00:41:20,642 --> 00:41:23,343
on every given day as it is.

918
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:25,178
"We."

919
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:28,915
Yeah.

920
00:41:32,253 --> 00:41:34,554
We.

921
00:41:37,092 --> 00:41:39,225
You'd really give up
that kind of money?

922
00:41:39,294 --> 00:41:41,761
You really gonna rub it in?

923
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,166
You'll at least meet
with my candidates?

924
00:41:47,235 --> 00:41:49,102
Of course.

925
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:54,407
Garrett can always use
another hand on deck.

926
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:06,319
One last thought.

927
00:42:07,756 --> 00:42:09,656
After I'm sworn in?

928
00:42:09,724 --> 00:42:11,357
What I say goes.

929
00:42:11,426 --> 00:42:14,861
(sighs)
Copy that, boss.
